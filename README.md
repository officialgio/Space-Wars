The program involves mainly the usage of javascript. The animating text used HTML/CSS; I found several text animations that caught my attention and learn them and implement them in the game. The game uses 2 p5.js libraries -- the usage of p5.particles and p5.collide2D. With the entire project -- Object Oriented Programming was used -- the game shows the basic fundemantals of Javascript.
